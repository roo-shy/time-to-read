#Challenge #1.1:
Inside a Javascript file called time-to-read.js, implement a function called timeToRead that calculates an estimated time in minutes required to read a web page. For the purpose of this challenge, assume the average words per minute (WPM) for your readers is 230. Count all the words on the page and return how long it would take to read that with your fixed average WPM. Goal #1.1: A Javascript function called timeToRead()

#Challenge #1.2:
Using DOM manipulation, display the estimated time to read on any web page we include time-to-read.js in. It should be visible at any point on the page, even after scrolling. It should be inserted from your Javascript file and attached to the body element inside an element with a class of time-to-read-view. Goal #1.2: Refined Javascript that attaches a new element to our HTML.
